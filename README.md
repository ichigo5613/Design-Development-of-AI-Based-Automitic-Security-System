# Design-Development-of-AI-Based-Automitic-Security-System
Developed a real-time Iris-based human identification system using CNN Deep learning models. After capturing image, process them for identification, and display results. If iris is  identified door unlocks automictically if not door is locked. 

#for running jupyter notebook file "iris_classification" file to Buid Model "model.h5"
step 1: download anaconda latest version
step 2: creat the New virtual environment in anaconda promt
Steps to creat the virtual environment
1.conda create -n Iris python=3.7
2.conda activate Iris 
3.pip install ipykernel
4.python -m ipykernel install --user --name Iris --display-name "Iris"
5.Install python libraries which are mentioned in module.txt file
Step 3: Open Jupyter Notebook & change Kernal to iris kerel & run iris_classification file

#for running python Files
Step 1: Install python latest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Step 2: Install python libraries which are mentioned in module.txt file
step 3: run application.py in command prompt

Update New dataset When your training the model, there are 5 classes, 1st 4 comes under known classes & last is unknown classe
